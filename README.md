On this project I was assigned to develop a backend server using POST SQL and Express.js. My job was to host the data on POST SQL Databse and connect it through express.js. Using query methods and setting up controlled responses to predifned routes, I was successfuly able to create my RESTful API. 
With this API I created a front-end REACT app to display the content of my API.
